# Liquid-level-monitoring-system
A wireless liquid level control system using Arduino and LabVIEW for real-time monitoring and automatic pump operation.
This project monitors and controls the liquid level in a tank using an ultrasonic sensor and a DC pump.
An Arduino reads the water level and sends the data via Bluetooth to LabVIEW for real-time visualization. 
When the level drops below a set threshold, the pump is automatically turned on and turned off once the desired level is reached. 
This system enables low-cost, wireless, and automated water management suitable for small-scale industrial or agricultural use.
